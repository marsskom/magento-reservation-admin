# Magento 2

Strange that I didn't find good Docker container for Magento 2.

I don't know why but [Official Bitnami](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/magento/#!) image not works correctly and Magento 2 app doesn't get up and freezes on database upgrade. Always.

But I found good solution, and maybe it will help for somebody: [Mark Shust's Docker Configuration for Magento ](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magentohttps://github.com/markshust/docker-magento).

Thanks, Mark!
